# WorkoutCalendar
My project in the works.

The goal of this project is to make a very simple working out that can do a few key things:
- Add workouts for a given day in a very simple way. There is a simple flow upon hitting the enter key on the keyboard to allow a quick flow between textfields.
- Save workouts for reuse later. This is basically a "favorites" section for workouts.
- Record a run. This includes distance traveled, time taken, number of laps, etc.
- Easily navigate through days of the month. I've implemented my own calendar view for this. Each cell represents a day of the month, and the background of the cell gives a preview to what workout you did that day.

When will this be done? No idea.
Will there be an iOS version? Unlikely.
Will there be a Windows version? No.
